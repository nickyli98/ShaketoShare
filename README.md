This project includes a webpage, and an Android app which connects to a Server in HKU. The purpose of the app is to function as a trade platform for excess construction waste, as Hong Kong has numerous ongoing construction and development projects, many of the waste ends up being sent to a landfill for a price, and then bought again for land reclamation and other uses.
